Lesson 1: Password Basics
L,,When you’re making a new online account, do you find that the hardest part of the process is coming up with a new password? All those crazy and confusing password requirements can make it unnecessarily difficult to choose a password that you can remember that will still fulfill those requirements. This short lesson will help teach you about some of the basics of making a truly strong password that is also easier to remember!,,Let’s Talk About Passwords,,c://fakepath
L,,First, the longer the password, the stronger it is! A long password without special characters or numbers is usually much stronger than a shorter password with special characters and numbers. Second, as much as it may make your life more difficult, reusing passwords across multiple websites should be avoided if possible, especially for very important accounts like your bank website. Lastly, filling your passwords with random numbers and special characters instead of letters really only makes it harder for you to remember without adding much security. As mentioned before, it’s a better idea to lengthen your password rather than complicate it.,,The Basics of Strong and Memorable Passwords,,c://fakepath
L,,Using a passphrase is a great way to lengthen your passwords while also keeping them memorable! Creating a random series of 3 or 4 words will make a password with a great length, while only having to remember those words! For example: “correct horse battery staple” is a passphrase that would be very hard for someone else to guess, but is easy to remember. Coming up with a story in your head to link those random words can make it even easier to remember!,,Passphrases,,c"//fakepath
